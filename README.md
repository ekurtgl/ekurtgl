### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a 4th year Ph.D. student at The University of Alabama. My research interest is mostly related to radar signal processing and human activity recognition with machine learning applications for radar data. Most recent projects include American Sign language (ASL) Recognition utilizing deep learning tools.
